### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Javad Sheikh, and this is my GitHub account. I am currently working on computer vision and deep learning for maritime and mining applications, including sea ice segmentation using satellite data and mineral prospectivity mapping with advanced machine learning methods. My expertise also spans AI model deployment on mobile platforms and geospatial data processing.
